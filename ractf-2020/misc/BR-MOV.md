The link https://youtu.be/zi3pLOaUUXs takes you to a video of someone saying numbers and lots of barcodes flashing.
Put this on playback speed x0.25, and scan each barcode, pausing when necessary.

You should get a list that looks like this:

7cyqggztfa

```

The numbers that are being said, you will realise, are the same numbers as the ones at the start of each string above.
So, take the first string and count 8 characters into the string. You get 'r'. 
Do this for each string and you can see where this goes...
